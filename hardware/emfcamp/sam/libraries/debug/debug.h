 TiLDA Mk2

 DebugTask
 If enable via the compile config this task will take debug messages from any
 source and pass them onto the enabled debug outputs
 This could be via the USB Serial, a Log file to the Flash
 or morse code to the LEDs, If we have the time ;)
 Also provide a way to use SerialUSB debug out side of the RTOS
 Note only DEBUG_USB will work if the RTOS is not running and the FlashTask is yet to be started
